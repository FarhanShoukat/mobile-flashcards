# Mobile Flashcards Project


A React Native app that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This aap is good example for those who are starting React and React Native. It covers a lot of topics like react components, controlled components, redux, actions, reducers, local notifications, async storage etc.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start`, `yarn start` or `expo start`

## Directory Structure

The project is structured in a standard way a react/redux app is structured i.e. actions, reducers, components are separated in their respective directories
